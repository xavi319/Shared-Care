# Shared-Care

SharedCare is a secure, user-friendly portal that helps nursing home caregivers share consistent, easy to understand updates with authorized families about a resident's day-to-day well-being. Instead of families feeling out of the loop or only hearing news when something is wrong, SharedCare provides predictable check-ins and activity updates in one place, reducing anxiety and miscommunication. Built with resident consent, privacy-first access controls, and HIPAA-aligned design principles, SharedCare strengthens trust while making communication faster and more sustainable for busy care teams.

## Codebase
